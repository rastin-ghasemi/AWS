## Amazon S3 Inventory
Amazon S3 Inventory provides a scheduled alternative to the List API for auditing and reporting on S3 objects and their metadata. It generates a comprehensive manifest (list) of objects in a bucket or prefix on a daily or weekly basis and delivers the report to another S3 bucket.

## Key Features:
Scheduled Reports: Generate inventories on a daily or weekly schedule.

Destination: Reports are delivered to a separate S3 bucket (in the same region).

Efficient Auditing: Provides a cost-effective way to audit object properties, encryption status, and replication state without performing high-cost LIST API calls.

Input for Batch Operations: S3 Inventory reports are a recommended manifest source for S3 Batch Operations.

## Delivery Frequency & Timing:
Daily: Reports are generated once a day and are typically delivered within 48 hours.

Weekly: Reports are generated once a week. The first report is delivered within 48 hours of configuration, and subsequent reports are delivered weekly.
